# Etch-a-Sketch

Etch-a-Sketch is an app that allows users to draw simply by hovering their mouse over a grid. Both the grid size and the drawing color (e.g. black, rainbow, and grayscale) are customizable for each user. There is also an eraser option, as well as an option to clear the grid and create a new one. This app was built as part of The Odin Project, in an effort to demonstrate DOM manipulation skills and knowledge of JavaScript.
